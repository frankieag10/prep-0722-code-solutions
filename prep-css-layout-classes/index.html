        <h3>Raiders of The Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>The year is 1936. An archeology professor named Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles of South America searching for
        a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap but miraculously escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum
        curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to human
        existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to
        fight his enemy Rene Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it.</p>

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>An art collector appeals to Indiana Jones to embark on a search for the Holy Grail. He learns that another archaeologist
        has disappeared while searching for the precious goblet, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones. The
        artifact is much harder to find than they expected, and its powers are too much for those impure of heart.</p>
